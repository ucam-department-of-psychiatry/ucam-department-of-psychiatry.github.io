   <h1>CamCOPS registration</h1>
   <p>
     If you are seeing this page it means that CamCOPS patient registration from
     Android devices isn't working. This could be because:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>You're not using an Android device.</li>
     <li>The CamCOPS app isn't installed. Search for CamCOPS on the Google Play Store.</li>
     <li>The CamCOPS app is installed but the version is too old. Please upgrade to at least version 2.4.22 from the Google Play Store.</li>
     <li>The version of Android is too old. You may need to enter your registration details manually.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     If you are in any doubt, please contact the relevant clinical or study team.
